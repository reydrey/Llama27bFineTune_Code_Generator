# Llama27bFineTune_Code_Generator
Finetuned Llama2 7-b to provide python code when prompted with an input and instruction. Used Peft libraries and QLoRA for more memory efficient training. 
The current version is still the first version, it is currently a work in progress and the entire file will be uploaded once completed.
